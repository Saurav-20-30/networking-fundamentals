# Ports and Protocols

Ports and protocols define how data is transferred between systems on a network. Understanding them is critical for cybersecurity.

## What Is a Port?
A port is a logical endpoint used by applications to communicate over a network.

## Common Ports and Services

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 21 | TCP | FTP |
| 22 | TCP | SSH |
| 23 | TCP | Telnet |
| 25 | TCP | SMTP |
| 53 | TCP/UDP | DNS |
| 80 | TCP | HTTP |
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS |

## TCP
- Reliable
- Connection-oriented
- Used in web and file transfer services

## UDP
- Fast
- Connectionless
- Used in DNS and streaming

## Security Perspective
- Open ports increase attack surface
- Unused ports should be closed
- Firewalls control port access
