# 🔌 Ports and Protocols

Ports and protocols define how data is transferred between systems on a network. Understanding them is critical for **cybersecurity**.

## ❓ What Is a Port?
A port is a logical endpoint used by applications to communicate over a network.

## 📌 Common Ports and Services

| Port | Protocol | Service |

## ⚡ TCP
- Reliable ✅
- Connection-oriented 🔗
- Used in web and file transfer services 🌐📁

## 💨 UDP
- Fast ⚡
- Connectionless 🚫🔗
- Used in DNS and streaming 🎥📡

## 🔐 Security Perspective
- Open ports increase attack surface ⚠️
- Unused ports should be closed 🔒
- Firewalls control port access 🛡️
