# TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is a practical networking model used for real-world communication over the internet. It forms the foundation of networking and cybersecurity.

## TCP/IP Layers
1. Application  
2. Transport  
3. Internet  
4. Network Access  

## Application Layer
**Function:**
- Provides services to user applications

**Protocols:**
- HTTP / HTTPS
- FTP
- SMTP
- DNS
- SSH

**Security Perspective:**
- Web-based attacks like SQL Injection and XSS occur here

## Transport Layer
**Function:**
- End-to-end communication

**Protocols:**
- TCP
- UDP

**Security Perspective:**
- SYN flood attacks
- Port scanning

## Internet Layer
**Function:**
- Logical addressing and routing

**Protocols:**
- IP
- ICMP
- ARP

**Security Perspective:**
- IP spoofing
- ICMP flooding

## Network Access Layer
**Function:**
- Physical data transmission

**Technologies:**
- Ethernet
- Wi-Fi

**Security Perspective:**
- MAC spoofing
- ARP poisoning

## Relevance to Cybersecurity
- Helps identify attack locations
- Essential for penetration testing
- Used in firewall and IDS/IPS placement
