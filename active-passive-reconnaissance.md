# 🔍 Active & Passive Reconnaissance (TryHackMe)

This document is based on my hands-on learning from the **TryHackMe Active and Passive Reconnaissance lab**.  
Reconnaissance is the first and most important phase of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

## 🕵️ What is Reconnaissance?
Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a target system, network, or organization.

- **Passive Reconnaissance** – No direct interaction with the target
- **Active Reconnaissance** – Direct interaction with the target system

## 🌐 Passive Reconnaissance

### 🔎 Whois
- Provides domain registration and ownership details
- Used to identify organization, registrar, and contact info

### 🌍 Browser Developer Tools
- Inspect HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Useful for finding hidden endpoints and comments

### 🏰 DNSDumpster
- Online tool for DNS enumeration
- Identifies subdomains, DNS records, and infrastructure

## ⚡ Active Reconnaissance

### 📡 Ping
- Checks if a host is reachable
- Uses ICMP protocol

### 🧭 Traceroute
- Displays the path packets take to reach a target
- Identifies intermediate hops

### 🛠️ Netcat
- Network utility for reading and writing data
- Used for banner grabbing and port interaction

### 💻 Telnet
- Used to connect to remote services
- Helpful for testing open ports and services

### 🔍 Nslookup
- Queries DNS servers for domain records
- Retrieves IP addresses and name server details

### 🧠 Dig
- Advanced DNS query tool
- Provides detailed DNS information
- Used for DNS enumeration
