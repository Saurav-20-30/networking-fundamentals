## 🧭 Traceroute
- Shows the path packets take to reach a destination
- Reveals intermediate network hops
- Useful for network mapping

## 📊 Netstat

- Shows listening ports and services
- Helps identify suspicious connections

## 🌐 Whois
- Provides domain ownership and registration details
- Useful in passive reconnaissance

## 🔎 Nslookup
